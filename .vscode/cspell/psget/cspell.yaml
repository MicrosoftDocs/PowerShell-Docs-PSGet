  This cSpell configuration is for PowerShellGet terminology. Only add to the dictionary defined
  here if the terms specifically apply to PowerShellGet or the PowerShell Gallery. If they apply to
  PowerShell more broadly, contribute those changes back to the psdocs configuration and
  dictionaries in the MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs repository, not here.
